The purpose of this project is to use data transformation and machine learning to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type.

Data The data for this model is fairly simplified as it has very few missing pieces. The raw data consists of a training dataset with the features listed above and their corresponding salaries.

Information Used To Predict Salaries Years Experience: How many years of experience Job Type: The position held (Business Analyst, Junior Consultunt,Senior Consultant....) Position Level : Experience in years (1,2,3.....)
